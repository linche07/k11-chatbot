    "description": "Coffee Made In Japanese Tea Ceremonial Tradition\n\nOMOTESANDO KOFFEE was founded in 2012 by Eiichi Kunitomo in the quaint yet stylish shopping area of Omotesando. What was intended to be nothing more than a one-year pop-up, soon became a destination for both locals and coffee fanatics from around the world — and it was obvious the coffee house was here to stay. Likening the original cube-shaped coffee bar to that of a traditional Japanese tea ceremony, the founder dreamed of his koffee reaching coffee aficionados and beginners alike, viewing coffee brewing as a craft that can be experienced by taste, texture, and quality of service. This is why OMOTESANDO KOFFEE believes each and every barista should take pride in their work, while aiming to brew the perfect cup of coffee for each and every customer.",

What was intended to be nothing more than a one-year pop-up, soon became a destination for both locals and coffee fanatics from around the world — and it was obvious the coffee house was here to stay. Likening the original cube-shaped coffee bar to that of a traditional Japanese tea ceremony, the founder dreamed of his koffee reaching coffee aficionados and beginners alike, viewing coffee brewing as a craft that can be experienced by taste, texture, and quality of service. This is why OMOTESANDO KOFFEE believes each and every barista should take pride in their work, while aiming to brew the perfect cup of coffee for each and every customer.",

    "description": "A Bite of Hong Kong Authenticity\n\nFounded by Mak King-hung initially as a dai-pai-dong (food stall) in 1968 on Gilman Street, Central, Mak’s Noodles inherits its flavour from his father in the 1940s and from Guangzhou’s King of Wonton Noodles. Its irresistible flavours has become a Hong Kong must-eat, making wonton noodles a classic local staple. Be it the blue-and-white china blow, tempting smell of egg noodles or a calming cup of tea, wonton noodles are a bowl of traditional Guangdong culinary art — still authentically made at Mak’s Noodles.",

Monsieur Lutens manifested his artistic visions began the olfactory revolution in the 1990s. Dissimilar though they may be, the fragrances all have something in common: they are the progeny of Serge Lutens’ imagination. According to Monsieur Lutens, “When you select a perfume you dare to be yourself. The choice is yours!”This pioneering designer brought a new look to women’s faces, breaking new ground in the use of make-up and colour. Serge Lutens decided to give the world of cosmetics a makeover, this time going back to basics, giving his range a self-explanatory name: BEAUTY ESSENTIALS.  Foundations, kohl eyeliner, lipsticks and other bare necessities allow women to make more of themselves with less. This collection of beauty products is all about the sophisticated gestures that get women noticed.",

This shift represented a first critical step in the modernisation of fashion and revolutionised the socio-cultural landscape. Under the creative direction of Anthony Vaccarello, appointed in April 2016, Saint Laurent Paris offers today a broad range of women’s and men’s ready-to-wear products, leather goods, shoes, jewellery and eyewear.",

    "description": "The largest store in Hong Kong\n\nFounded in 1870 by William Penhaligon, Penhaligon’s is a heritage fragrance house with a dedication to creating scented stories. Its legacy started from the birth of ‘Hammam Bouquet’ — Penhaligon’s first fragrance launched in 1872 — which was created after the smell of the Turkish baths located next to his first boutique on Jermyn Street, London. Since then, the house continues to challenge the traditions of the art and seek new ways to interpret elegance with each and every of its creations. Holding two long-standing Royal Warrants, Penhaligon’s is passionate about ingredients and still manufactures its scents in England using the finest rare ingredients.",

In 1533, young Catherine de Medici chose her personal perfumer from Santa Maria Novella to accompany her to France, where the iconic scent ‘Acqua della Regina' was born. Since then, Santa Maria Novella has evolved into a prestigious brand with a legacy spanning the globe.",

    "description": "Born in 1971, the roots of Mulberry are in Somerset, England. Mulberry’s founder, Roger Saul, established the brand at his kitchen table, with £500 backing from his mother. His sister designed our instantly-recognisable tree logo - both that, and the name “Mulberry” come from the trees he would pass each day on his way to school. Mulberry's heritage - and hence our identity - is quintessentially British. Early inspiration was drawn from the styles synonymous with English rural pursuits - hunting, shooting, fishing. Mulberry today offers a unique point of view on heritage. We continue to celebrate the contradictions of a truly British identity, looking back to our archives and rich British traditions and examining them from a new perspective. A sense of the past reinvented with the spirit of now. Heritage yet modern, classic, yet unclassic.",

Physicist by day, star-gazer and dreamer by night, he hoped to unlock the healing power of the sea he held so dear.6,000 experiments and 12 years of searching led to the epiphany of a lifetime – a fermentation process that transformed sea kelp and other pure ingredients into the miracle that would help transform his skin.",

    "description": "To prepare for the future, we look to the past. As a new reality sets in at KENZO, Artistic Director Nigo reconnects with the values entrenched in the early beginnings of the Maison: designer fashion created for real life, imbued with the playful urbanity of Kenzo Takada’s timeless legacy. A creative exchange, KENZO becomes an evolving dialogue between the pop culture of the founder’s heritage and the street culture inherent to Nigo.Through Nigo’s instinct for contemporary design, a new vision takes shape at KENZO: ‘real-to-wear’, a genuine wardrobe founded in the authentic desires of the post-digital mentality. It is a realistic approach to fashion, which transcends the conventional labels of ‘formal’, ‘casual’ or ‘street’ in favour of the syntheses that make up real wardrobes today.A series of encounters take place: the everlasting codes of KENZO are considered through an instant lens, the ‘Jungle’ fashion of its founder is distilled into succinctly covetable items, and a new sense of exclusivity heightens the universal appeal key to the Maison’s history. In the encounter between the founder and the heir, the core of KENZO is amplified: unconventional fashion for the future rooted in the permanence of its past.",

His artisanal skill and artistic talent combined with his continuous ability to identify and support design talent was the foundation on which he built Georg Jensen in Copenhagen in 1904.Georg Jensen’s style embraced the Art Nouveau lines of the day but injected them with a distinctive vigour that continues to resonate today. Serene flowing forms are enriched by exquisitely sculpted ornamentation and his stylised bouquets of flowers and lush bunches of grapes reflect his sensual delight in nature. Our most important task is to leverage the ideas and principles of the master himself and translate these into the design of the present day.",

Today EVISU has gained critical acclaim, as one of the ultimate denim must haves, is internationally known and embraced by both collectors and hipsters alike. EVISU was initially more a labour of love than a commercial venture and despite phenomenal success EVISU’s mission to create the highest quality products has remained unchanged.

    "description": "Expertly Crafting Oriental-styled Jewellery of Refined Elegance\n\nFollowing the interest in beautiful Chinese court jewellery sought after by European royals and aristocrats in the 17th century, European jewellery suppliers began to incorporate Chinese elements with their expert craftsmanship to create pieces with oriental flavour, giving way to the cultural exchange of ideas, philosophies, art, and objects. In 1968, a small jewellery workshop in Rome, Italy specialising in Oriental-styled pieces created the “Hidden Dragon” earrings — a masterpiece stirring the hearts of European jewellery-lovers at the time. This was the birth of ChuCui Palace.",

    "description": "Capturing style is a talent. A talent that Gabrielle Chanel instinctively had more than anyone, detecting what would make all the difference to a silhouette. In 1957, after she had already made the little black dress, the tweed braided suit and the quilted handbag – all essentials in women's wardrobes – Mademoiselle Chanel decided to introduce a new note to a woman's allure: two-tone shoes. \"They are\", she said, \"The height of elegance.\"Sixty years after its creation, CHANEL's two-tone shoe has been continuously enriched with new versions, thanks to the unexpected interpretations and constantly renewed creativity. As a high heel, a ballerina, a boot, a sneaker and even an espadrille, the two-tone shoe is today, more than ever, a true fashion accessory that combines timeless elegance, comfort and modernity.",

    "description": "Maison Balmain's Enduring Allure Meets Modern Elegance: Discover the Summer Collection at K11 MUSEA Exclusive Pop-up\n\nMore than 75 years ago, when Pierre Balmain first introduced his “New French Style,” it immediately became clear to all that his eponymous house was offering a distinctly fresh, bold, and feminine conception of haute couture, one which broke with many of the well-established conventions of the era. His audaciousness paid off. Pierre Balmain became one of the handful of young French talents who ushered in the mid-century golden age of couture and helped to re-establish Paris as the world’s fashion capital. Since 2011, Balmain Creative Director Olivier Rousteing has been inventively building upon Pierre Balmain’s extraordinary legacy, while always remaining true to his own determination to design clothes that reflect the way his inclusive, powerful and global Balmain Army wishes to live today. The result is 21st-Century Balmain’s renewed French style—a unique and instantly recognizable house silhouette and attitude that highlights the singular craftsmanship of the celebrated Balmain ateliers, while consistently referencing a rich Parisian heritage.",

      "K11 Event”Hybrid Zone” — A Space of Eastern and Western Cultural Convergence by Edna ChaA study into Hong Kong’s historical development as shaped by the merging of East and Western…cultures, homegrown artist Edna Cha’s showcase at CEMENT, K11 MUSEA is an artist survey of the multifaceted legacy of the past international concessions that co-existed within the city. \n\nRepresenting a unique urban landscape where Eastern and Western cultures converged, these hybrid concessions construct a vibrant human landscape that characterises the city’s urban enclaves, from colonial buildings to marketplaces. \n\nCha explores the concessions’ significance in shaping hybrid zones’ urban development, facilitating cross-cultural exchange, and impacting the city’s architectural and cultural heritage. From pop-up installations featuring Cha’s re-invented optical devices, accordion-style hand-painted works, accordion-style handmade time-tunnels, and Shanghai-style fans, the pop-up also showcases Cha's collection of research on the former concessions, including rare optical instruments, unique edition of the \"Dianshizhai Pictorial\" magazine, French art monthly publications and the \"Flourishing\" series of Shaoxing wine jars. \n\nCha's work draws inspiration from the literary imagination of his father, the renowned martial arts novelist Jin Yong, exploring unconventional global perspectives on the diverse and vibrant landscapes of the former concessions. \n\nCha's works aspire to serve as a multi-dimensional exploration of the concessions' legacy, celebrating their diversity while acknowledging the socio-political dynamics that underscored their existence. The pop-up may inspire critical reflection on the enduring influence of the colonial past.\n\nDate: 5 Aug 2024 – 1 Sep 2024\nOpening Hours: 11AM – 9PM\nLocation: CEMENT, G31, G/F, MUSE EDITION, K11 MUSEACEMENT, G31, G/F, MUSE EDITION, K11 MUSEA": "https://www.k11musea.com/happenings/hybrid-zone-a-space-of-eastern-and-western-cultural-convergence-by-edna-cha/",

    "description": "A study into Hong Kong’s historical development as shaped by the merging of East and Western cultures, homegrown artist Edna Cha’s showcase at CEMENT, K11 MUSEA is an artist survey of the multifaceted legacy of the past international concessions that co-existed within the city.Representing a unique urban landscape where Eastern and Western cultures converged, these hybrid concessions construct a vibrant human landscape that characterises the city’s urban enclaves, from colonial buildings to marketplaces.Cha explores the concessions’ significance in shaping hybrid zones’ urban development, facilitating cross-cultural exchange, and impacting the city’s architectural and cultural heritage. From pop-up installations featuring Cha’s re-invented optical devices, accordion-style hand-painted works, accordion-style handmade time-tunnels, and Shanghai-style fans, the pop-up also showcases Cha's collection of research on the former concessions, including rare optical instruments, unique edition of the \"Dianshizhai Pictorial\" magazine, French art monthly publications and the \"Flourishing\" series of Shaoxing wine jars.Cha's work draws inspiration from the literary imagination of his father, the renowned martial arts novelist Jin Yong, exploring unconventional global perspectives on the diverse and vibrant landscapes of the former concessions.Cha's works aspire to serve as a multi-dimensional exploration of the concessions' legacy, celebrating their diversity while acknowledging the socio-political dynamics that underscored their existence. The pop-up may inspire critical reflection on the enduring influence of the colonial past.Date: 5 Aug 2024 – 1 Sep 2024Opening Hours: 11AM – 9PMLocation: CEMENT, G31, G/F, MUSE EDITION, K11 MUSEA",

      "K11 Event”Hybrid Zone” — A Space of Eastern and Western Cultural Convergence by Edna ChaA study into Hong Kong’s historical development as shaped by the merging of East and Western…cultures, homegrown artist Edna Cha’s showcase at CEMENT, K11 MUSEA is an artist survey of the multifaceted legacy of the past international concessions that co-existed within the city. \n\nRepresenting a unique urban landscape where Eastern and Western cultures converged, these hybrid concessions construct a vibrant human landscape that characterises the city’s urban enclaves, from colonial buildings to marketplaces. \n\nCha explores the concessions’ significance in shaping hybrid zones’ urban development, facilitating cross-cultural exchange, and impacting the city’s architectural and cultural heritage. From pop-up installations featuring Cha’s re-invented optical devices, accordion-style hand-painted works, accordion-style handmade time-tunnels, and Shanghai-style fans, the pop-up also showcases Cha's collection of research on the former concessions, including rare optical instruments, unique edition of the \"Dianshizhai Pictorial\" magazine, French art monthly publications and the \"Flourishing\" series of Shaoxing wine jars. \n\nCha's work draws inspiration from the literary imagination of his father, the renowned martial arts novelist Jin Yong, exploring unconventional global perspectives on the diverse and vibrant landscapes of the former concessions. \n\nCha's works aspire to serve as a multi-dimensional exploration of the concessions' legacy, celebrating their diversity while acknowledging the socio-political dynamics that underscored their existence. The pop-up may inspire critical reflection on the enduring influence of the colonial past.\n\nDate: 5 Aug 2024 – 1 Sep 2024\nOpening Hours: 11AM – 9PM\nLocation: CEMENT, G31, G/F, MUSE EDITION, K11 MUSEACEMENT, G31, G/F, MUSE EDITION, K11 MUSEA": "https://www.k11musea.com/happenings/hybrid-zone-a-space-of-eastern-and-western-cultural-convergence-by-edna-cha/",

      "K11 EventArt @ Harbour — “l’ordre des mondes (Totem)” by Alicja KwadeAs part of Art @ Harbour, K11 MUSEA, in collaboration with Pace Gallery, presents the global debut…of Alicja Kwade’s monumental sculpture, l’ordre des mondes (Totem).\n\nWith l’ordre des mondes (Totem), Alicja Kwade playfully explores the relationship between human existence and the universe. The marble spheres, distinguished by their varied colours and sizes, evoke planets and alien worlds. These spheres are mounted within a towering structure of chairs — everyday objects that introduce an abstract scale in contrast to the otherwise monumental planets. The artwork challenges the notion of humanity being at the centre of the universe while confronting the power that confronts us when we expand our horizons to contemplate the boundless expanse of space. \n\nThe title l’ordre des mondes (Totem) is a reference to Italian artist Piero Manzoni’s bronze sculpture Socle du Monde from 1961, on which the inscription must be read upside down. In the act of reading, the pedestal suddenly appears inverted, serving as the foundation for the world resting upon it. Observant yet impartial, Alicja Kwade prompts us to reflect on our relationship with the world. What value do we attribute to the Earth? And on which hierarchical level do we place ourselves in the universe? \n\nDate: 23 Mar – Nov 2024\nLocation: G/F, Promenade, K11 MUSEAG/F, Promenade, K11 MUSEA": "https://www.k11musea.com/happenings/art-harbour-l-ordre-des-mondes-totem-by-alicja-kwade/",

From pop-up installations featuring Cha’s re-invented optical devices, accordion-style hand-painted works, accordion-style handmade time-tunnels, and Shanghai-style fans, the pop-up also showcases Cha's collection of research on the former concessions, including rare optical instruments, unique edition of the \"Dianshizhai Pictorial\" magazine, French art monthly publications and the \"Flourishing\" series of Shaoxing wine jars. \n\nCha's work draws inspiration from the literary imagination of his father, the renowned martial arts novelist Jin Yong, exploring unconventional global perspectives on the diverse and vibrant landscapes of the former concessions. \n\nCha's works aspire to serve as a multi-dimensional exploration of the concessions' legacy, celebrating their diversity while acknowledging the socio-political dynamics that underscored their existence. The pop-up may inspire critical reflection on the enduring influence of the colonial past.\n\nDate: 5 Aug 2024 – 1 Sep 2024\nOpening Hours: 11AM – 9PM\nLocation: CEMENT, G31, G/F, MUSE EDITION, K11 MUSEACEMENT, G31, G/F, MUSE EDITION, K11 MUSEA": "https://www.k11musea.com/happenings/hybrid-zone-a-space-of-eastern-and-western-cultural-convergence-by-edna-cha/",

      "K11 EventArt @ Harbour — “l’ordre des mondes (Totem)” by Alicja KwadeAs part of Art @ Harbour, K11 MUSEA, in collaboration with Pace Gallery, presents the global debut…of Alicja Kwade’s monumental sculpture, l’ordre des mondes (Totem).\n\nWith l’ordre des mondes (Totem), Alicja Kwade playfully explores the relationship between human existence and the universe. The marble spheres, distinguished by their varied colours and sizes, evoke planets and alien worlds. These spheres are mounted within a towering structure of chairs — everyday objects that introduce an abstract scale in contrast to the otherwise monumental planets. The artwork challenges the notion of humanity being at the centre of the universe while confronting the power that confronts us when we expand our horizons to contemplate the boundless expanse of space. \n\nThe title l’ordre des mondes (Totem) is a reference to Italian artist Piero Manzoni’s bronze sculpture Socle du Monde from 1961, on which the inscription must be read upside down. In the act of reading, the pedestal suddenly appears inverted, serving as the foundation for the world resting upon it. Observant yet impartial, Alicja Kwade prompts us to reflect on our relationship with the world. What value do we attribute to the Earth? And on which hierarchical level do we place ourselves in the universe? \n\nDate: 23 Mar – Nov 2024\nLocation: G/F, Promenade, K11 MUSEAG/F, Promenade, K11 MUSEA": "https://www.k11musea.com/happenings/art-harbour-l-ordre-des-mondes-totem-by-alicja-kwade/",

      "K11 EventArt @ Harbour — “l’ordre des mondes (Totem)” by Alicja KwadeAs part of Art @ Harbour, K11 MUSEA, in collaboration with Pace Gallery, presents the global debut…of Alicja Kwade’s monumental sculpture, l’ordre des mondes (Totem).\n\nWith l’ordre des mondes (Totem), Alicja Kwade playfully explores the relationship between human existence and the universe. The marble spheres, distinguished by their varied colours and sizes, evoke planets and alien worlds. These spheres are mounted within a towering structure of chairs — everyday objects that introduce an abstract scale in contrast to the otherwise monumental planets. The artwork challenges the notion of humanity being at the centre of the universe while confronting the power that confronts us when we expand our horizons to contemplate the boundless expanse of space. \n\nThe title l’ordre des mondes (Totem) is a reference to Italian artist Piero Manzoni’s bronze sculpture Socle du Monde from 1961, on which the inscription must be read upside down. In the act of reading, the pedestal suddenly appears inverted, serving as the foundation for the world resting upon it. Observant yet impartial, Alicja Kwade prompts us to reflect on our relationship with the world. What value do we attribute to the Earth? And on which hierarchical level do we place ourselves in the universe? \n\nDate: 23 Mar – Nov 2024\nLocation: G/F, Promenade, K11 MUSEAG/F, Promenade, K11 MUSEA": "https://www.k11musea.com/happenings/art-harbour-l-ordre-des-mondes-totem-by-alicja-kwade/"

      "K11 EventArt @ Harbour — “l’ordre des mondes (Totem)” by Alicja KwadeAs part of Art @ Harbour, K11 MUSEA, in collaboration with Pace Gallery, presents the global debut…of Alicja Kwade’s monumental sculpture, l’ordre des mondes (Totem).\n\nWith l’ordre des mondes (Totem), Alicja Kwade playfully explores the relationship between human existence and the universe. The marble spheres, distinguished by their varied colours and sizes, evoke planets and alien worlds. These spheres are mounted within a towering structure of chairs — everyday objects that introduce an abstract scale in contrast to the otherwise monumental planets. The artwork challenges the notion of humanity being at the centre of the universe while confronting the power that confronts us when we expand our horizons to contemplate the boundless expanse of space. \n\nThe title l’ordre des mondes (Totem) is a reference to Italian artist Piero Manzoni’s bronze sculpture Socle du Monde from 1961, on which the inscription must be read upside down. In the act of reading, the pedestal suddenly appears inverted, serving as the foundation for the world resting upon it. Observant yet impartial, Alicja Kwade prompts us to reflect on our relationship with the world. What value do we attribute to the Earth? And on which hierarchical level do we place ourselves in the universe? \n\nDate: 23 Mar – Nov 2024\nLocation: G/F, Promenade, K11 MUSEAG/F, Promenade, K11 MUSEA": "https://www.k11musea.com/happenings/art-harbour-l-ordre-des-mondes-totem-by-alicja-kwade/",
